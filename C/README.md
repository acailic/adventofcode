# Advent of Code in C
 
Possible to build using CMake. Builds with pre-defined custom targets for each day.
To build run
```cmake -B build .```

To run a specific day, for example Day 1 2021 run:
```cd build
make run_2021_01
```

Or to run a specific year, for example 2021, run:
```
cd build
make run_2021
```

Replace ```make``` above with whatever build system you choose to use in CMake
